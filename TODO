allow vector to be multiplied by matrix

think about adding a linearComb function to do slightly faster linear combinations

setup line intersection func

update vector unit tests with tests including matrices

ensure we can past a list of vectors to matrix.init

pyobject_del in deinits?

use struct Vectors in matrices, not pyobjects

move static function prototypes to top of .c file

seven dimensional cross prod

allow matrix initialization passing *args of iterables

move all error messages of functions calling pynumber_as_long and pynumber_as_vector_type into those functions, use PyErr_Occurred in calling functions
