think about adding a linearComb function to do slightly faster linear combinations

setup line intersection func

pyobject_del in deinits?

use struct Vectors in matrices, not pyobjects; use non-py matrices where a temp matrix is needed (strassen!)

seven dimensional cross prod

help() docstrings for functions, especially init

-- upper tri -> RRE for factor functions

partial pivoting in inverse alg


POINT CLASS
DOCUMENTATION

CAN'T USE OUT AS A TEMP BUFFER. ONLY A FINAL SOLUTION :( - MAKE 4 NEW TEMP BUFFERS IE 1 NEW REGULAR SIZED BUFFER SPLIT INTO 4

script to determine ideal strassen size

smart padding add/sub - don't do extra work comparing 0's - but before this, strassen unit tests

see about iterative strassen algorith, conserve memory
